## **Project synopsis:**

Is public infrastructure able to keep pace with growth in Urban areas? A few critical factors to analyze are:

* Housing situation (cost/availability)
* Traffic congestion/Commutation time
* Air traffic 
* Environmental (Green spaces/play areas/air quality)

We intend to analyze impact of economic growth and its impact on above indicators for selected geographies. We will make a webpage with responsive contents/multi-layer charts(minimum 3), also pulling in some highlights from related web pages. The web page will have interactive navigation with drop down menu selections & text boxes.
